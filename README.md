# Telangana-Transportation
Iâ€™ve developed a data visualization dashboard that provides detailed insights into Telangana's transportation trends. This interactive report enables government agencies, planners, and analysts better to understand patterns in transportation usage and infrastructure needs.

Key Capabilities:
 Breaks down monthly transportation data
 Visualizes year-wise and month-wise performance
 Identifies key trends in state-level transport usage
 Adds new analytical columns using DAX (Month and Year)

Problems This Project Can Solve:
 Lack of visibility into seasonal or monthly transportation usage fluctuations
 Inefficient allocation of state transportation resources
 Difficulty identifying long-term growth trends in public transport
 Absence of accessible, visual reports for decision-makers
 Need for data-driven infrastructure planning at the state level
Highlights:
 Year values extracted for improved time-based analysis
 Clear and minimal dashboard design
 Easy-to-read visuals for stakeholders with no technical background
 Understanding public transportation usage is essential for improving infrastructure, optimizing resources, and enabling data-informed decision-making.
